## 🔥 Hi!
I'm a 17 y.o. boy. I've tried many different things to do: 2D/3D game development (without game engine, pure C++ code with some library like OpenGL, SFML...), competitive programming (that is informatics olympiads, contests, problem solving), interpreter development, and many other cool things.

**My favourite programming book is Elegant Objects**

### 🧑‍💻 What am I doing??
I am currently learning web development (MERN tech stack, GraphQL API).

### What am I using???
My favourite tool set is 
- *linux* (fedora)
- *vim/neovim* (tried emacs too)
- *i3 window manager*
- *XTerm* (kitty is good too).

### Skill set (of course, it's not complete...)
- 🚑️ C++ (2 years+ of experience, can write in it *almost* everything I want)
- 👷 C (2-3 month of experience, it may take much time to write smth valuable)
- 🚀 Rust (I tried it and understood that it is what I want to learn later)
- 💄 Ruby (I know its syntax...)
- 🔧 Java (less than 1 month of experience, tried to write some basic stuff)
- 🔨 JS (started exploring it some weeks ago and I'm still doing it)
- ⚰️ asm (elf x64 nasm, know only basic stuff like control flow, syscalls, labels...)
- 🤡 Go (1-2 months of experience, RESTful APIs and web backends with Gin)
- 💡 Python (2-3 months of experience, it was my first language)
