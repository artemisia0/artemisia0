## Sup dude!
I'm a 17 y.o. boy who's going to become not so bad software engineer. I've tried many different things to do: 2D/3D game development (without game engine, pure C++ code with some library like OpenGL, SFML...), competitive programming (that is informatics olympiads, contests, problem solving), and many other cool things.

### What I'm doing??
I am currently learning web development (MERN tech stack, GraphQL API).

### Skill set (it's not full of course...)
- C++ (2 years+ of experience, can write in it *almost* everything I want)
- C (2-3 month of experience, it may take much time to write smth valuable)
- Rust (I tried it and understood that it is what I want to learn later)
- Ruby (I know its syntax...)
- Java (less than 1 month of experience, tried to write some basic stuff)
- JS (started exploring it some weeks ago and still I'm doing it)
- asm (elf x64 nasm, know only basic stuff like control flow, syscalls, labels...)
- Go (1-2 months of experience, RESTful APIs and web backends with Gin)
- Python (2-3 months of experience, it was my first language)
